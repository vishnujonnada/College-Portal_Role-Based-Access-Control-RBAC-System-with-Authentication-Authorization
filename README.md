# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System - Node.js & Express.js

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates an **Authentication** and **Authorization** system built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, incorporating **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. The system allows users to securely register, log in, and log out, with their roles (Admin, Moderator, User) determining their access to different resources or actions. 

🔒 **Security Features**:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management
- **Password hashing** for secure user authentication
- Custom **Role-Based Authorization** system that restricts access based on roles

**Project Summary**:
This project is a powerful and user-friendly system designed to make managing student activities more efficient. It’s built to serve both administrators and students, offering secure login and management features. Using Express.js, Mongoose, bcryptjs, and JWT, the system ensures that both admins and students can securely register and log in. Admins have special privileges to manage student data, track attendance, and send important notifications, all while using role-based access control to ensure that everything stays secure. Students, on the other hand, can register and access their own accounts, with their passwords safely hashed using bcryptjs.

One of the standout features is the attendance tracking system, which allows both admins and students to easily view and monitor attendance records. To keep everyone updated on important events, the project also includes a notification system, making sure no key information gets missed. Plus, with the calendar management feature, admins can easily schedule and track events, exams, and other important activities. Real-time communication is made seamless through Socket.io, ensuring that updates—like attendance being marked or notifications being sent—happen instantly. 

On the backend, MongoDB is used to securely store user data, attendance records, notifications, and calendar events, ensuring smooth data management throughout. In essence, this project is all about providing secure, streamlined tools to manage student activities, keep everyone in the loop, and ensure that everything runs efficiently.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Users can be assigned roles like Admin, Moderator, or User, with access restrictions based on their roles.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain endpoints are restricted to specific roles. For example, only Admins can access management routes.
  
## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Password Hashing
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data and role management)
  
## 👨‍💻 How It Works
1. **User Registration**: New users can register and are assigned a role.
2. **Login and JWT Generation**: Once logged in, a JWT is generated, and users can access routes based on their roles.
3. **Access Control**: Each route checks the user’s role to determine if they have permission to access the resource.

## 💼 Project Highlights
- **Secure Authentication** with JWT and hashed passwords.
- **Role-Based Authorization** integrated into all routes, ensuring only authorized roles can access restricted resources.
- **Scalable Structure** for adding more roles and permissions as needed.
