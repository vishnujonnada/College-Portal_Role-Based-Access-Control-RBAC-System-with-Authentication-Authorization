# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System - Node.js & Express.js

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates an **Authentication** and **Authorization** system built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, incorporating **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. The system allows users to securely register, log in, and log out, with their roles (Admin, Moderator, User) determining their access to different resources or actions. 

🔒 **Security Features**:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management
- **Password hashing** for secure user authentication
- Custom **Role-Based Authorization** system that restricts access based on roles

## 🚀 Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Users can be assigned roles like Admin, Moderator, or User, with access restrictions based on their roles.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain endpoints are restricted to specific roles. For example, only Admins can access management routes.
  
## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Password Hashing
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data and role management)
  
## 👨‍💻 How It Works
1. **User Registration**: New users can register and are assigned a role.
2. **Login and JWT Generation**: Once logged in, a JWT is generated, and users can access routes based on their roles.
3. **Access Control**: Each route checks the user’s role to determine if they have permission to access the resource.

## 💼 Project Highlights
- **Secure Authentication** with JWT and hashed passwords.
- **Role-Based Authorization** integrated into all routes, ensuring only authorized roles can access restricted resources.
- **Scalable Structure** for adding more roles and permissions as needed.
